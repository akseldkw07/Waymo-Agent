\section*{Modeling Setup}
\subsection*{State}
Discrete-Time Markov Decision Process (MDP)

Time steps are 1 minute long

\tbf{Environment}
\begin{itemize}
		\item Static class - no state changes
		\item Embedded into $l_2$
		\item Graph -
				\begin{itemize}
						\item Nodes - intersections
						\item Edges - roads
				\end{itemize}
		\item Vertices -
				\begin{itemize}
						\item Static class - no state changes
						\item Embedded into $l_2$
				\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
\tbf{Fleet}
\begin{itemize}
		\item n=10? vehicles
		\item Per vehicle:
    \begin{itemize}
						\item Vehicle ID
						\item Location
						\item Battery level (percentage)
						\item Status (available, en route to pickup, with passenger, en route to charging station)
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\medskip
\tbf{Demand}
I'm a little unsure about whether this should be \tit{explicitly} modeled in the state or
"learned" by the
agent. I'm learning towards the former for a few reasons
\begin{enumerate}
		\item It's relatively independent of the actions of the agent
		\item It can be estimated from historical data
		\item Both assumptions above are likely to be true in the real world
		\item It greatly simplifies the learning problem
\end{enumerate}
If we do explicitly model it
\begin{itemize}
		\item Location
		\item Expected demand (number of requests) in next time step
\end{itemize}

\medskip
\tbf{Ride Requests}
\begin{itemize}
    % The variable $n_v$ represents a random variable following a Poisson distribution,
				% typically denoted as $n_v \sim \mathrm{Poisson}(\Lambda)$, where $\Lambda$ is the
				% rate parameter
    % (expected value) of the distribution.
		\item $n_v \sim \mathrm{Poisson}(\Lambda)$ new requests per time step (this lives in Demand class)
		\item Each request:
				\begin{itemize}
						\item Request ID
						\item Pickup location
						\item Dropoff location
						\item Request time
						\item Status (pending, assigned, completed, cancelled)
				\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\medskip
\tbf{Active Rides}
I'm a little less sure about this one, but I think that this class should mostly serve as
an enriched
tuple between a vehicle and a ride request
\begin{itemize}
		\item Matched Vehicle ID
		\item Request ID
		\item Status (en route to pickup, with passenger)
		\item Time to pickup (minutes)
		\item Duration of ride (minutes)
		\item Estimated remaining time (minutes)
\end{itemize}
\end{document}
