\section*{Modeling Setup}
\subsection*{State}
Discrete-Time Markov Decision Process (MDP)

Time steps are 1 minute long

\tbf{Environment}
\begin{itemize}
		\item Locations will be represented either/or as latitude/longitude coordinates or as
				nodes on a graph (any point on vertex is proportional distance between endpoints)
\end{itemize}
\tbf{Fleet}
\begin{itemize}
		\item n=10? vehicles
		\item Per vehicle:
    \begin{itemize}
						\item Vehicle ID
						\item Location
						\item Battery level (percentage)
						\item Status (available, en route to pickup, with passenger, en route to charging station)
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\tbf{Demand}
\begin{itemize}
		\item
\end{itemize}
\tbf{Ride Requests}
\begin{itemize}
    % The variable $n_v$ represents a random variable following a Poisson distribution,
				% typically denoted as $n_v \sim \mathrm{Poisson}(\Lambda)$, where $\Lambda$ is the
				% rate parameter
    % (expected value) of the distribution.
		\item $n_v \sim \mathrm{Poisson}(\Lambda)$ new requests per time step
		\item Each request:
				\begin{itemize}
						\item Request ID
						\item Pickup location
						\item Dropoff location
						\item Request time
						\item Status (pending, assigned, completed, cancelled)
				\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
\tbf{Active Rides}
I'm a little less sure about this one, but I think that this class should mostly serve as
an enriched
tuple between a vehicle and a ride request
\begin{itemize}
		\item Matched Vehicle ID
		\item Request ID
		\item Status (en route to pickup, with passenger)
		\item Time to pickup (minutes)
		\item Duration of ride (minutes)
		\item Estimated remaining time (minutes)
\end{itemize}
\newpage
We model the state as a tuple $(t, F, R, D)$ where:
\begin{itemize}
		\item $t$ is the current time step (discretized to 10 minute intervals)
		\item $F$ is a list of all vehicles in the fleet, where each vehicle is represented as
				a tuple $(id, loc, status, battery, time\_to\_maintenance)$
    \begin{itemize}
						\item $id$ is a unique identifier for the vehicle
						\item $loc$ is the current location of the vehicle (latitude, longitude)
						\item $status$ is the current status of the vehicle (available, en route to pickup,
								with passenger, en route to charging station, en route to maintenance)
						\item $battery$ is the current battery level of the vehicle (percentage)
						\item $time\_   to\_maintenance$ is the time remaining until the vehicle requires
								maintenance (in hours)
    \end{itemize}
		\item $R$ is a list of all ride requests, where each request is represented as a tuple
				$(id, pickup\_loc, dropoff\_loc, request\_time, status)$
    \begin{itemize}
						\item $id$ is a unique identifier for the request
						\item $pickup\_loc$ is the location of the pickup (latitude, longitude)
						\item $dropoff\_loc$ is the location of the dropoff (latitude, longitude)
						\item $request\_time$ is the time the request was made
						\item $status$ is the current status of the request (pending, assigned, completed, cancelled)
    \end{itemize}
		\item $D$ is a list of all demand hotspots, where each hotspot is represented as a
				tuple $(loc, expected\_demand)$
    \begin{itemize}
						\item $loc$ is the location of the hotspot (latitude, longitude)
						\item $expected\_demand$ is the expected number of ride requests in the next time step
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
