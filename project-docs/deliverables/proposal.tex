\subsection*{Problem Statement}
One of the most promising and revolutionary applications of reinforcement learning is in
the domain of autonomous robots,
specifically self-driving cars. There are many challenges in this domain: intellectual,
ethical, technical, and more.
For our project, we've decided to narrow our focus to the specific problem of optimizing
the profitability of a fleet of
self-driving cars.
